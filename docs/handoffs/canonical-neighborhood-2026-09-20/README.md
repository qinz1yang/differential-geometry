# Canonical-neighborhood source estimates

This phase starts from handoff commit `4d7a0cbc071b3b10f5540a339772a9401a0814b3`, whose parent is
the previous proof commit `3b12c1abf575960b58f7adca8f73c54c7ea5049b`. Work remains on
`codex/pc-work-2026-09-17`.

## Proven source estimates

Commit `12a12b7800bec88f9beff085043e7f510a175f47` proves the following results.

- `DifferentialGeometry.PDE.RicciFlow.shi_curvDerivNorm_terminal_of_terminal_ball`, in
  `DifferentialGeometry/Geometry/Flow/RicciFlow/Estimates/Shi/Derivatives/TerminalBall.lean`:
  a curvature bound on a compact fixed terminal ball over a closed backward time interval gives
  every fixed curvature derivative bound at its center at the actual terminal endpoint. The proof
  derives metric comparison from an absolute Ricci estimate, proves containment of a buffered
  earlier-time ball, and applies the existing endpoint Shi theorem on that ball. No source Ricci
  sign or positive-time extension is assumed. Dimensions zero and one are covered by the zero
  curvature derivative theorems.
- `exists_curvDerivNorm_le_on_scalar_sublevel`, in
  `DifferentialGeometry/Geometry/Flow/RicciFlow/Perelman/CanonicalNeighborhood/NormalizedTerminalDerivatives.lean`:
  for sufficiently small epsilon, normalized sources have a uniform terminal curvature derivative
  bound of each fixed order on every scalar sublevel set. The epsilon threshold depends on kappa;
  the resulting bound may depend on the sequence, scalar threshold, and derivative order.
- `exists_curvDerivNorm_bound_on_terminal_ball`, in the same file: a positive radius depending on
  kappa works for all sufficiently small epsilon and all normalized sequences. On this terminal
  base ball, every fixed derivative order has a bound uniform over all source indices.
- `exists_terminalDerivativeBounds_of_boundedAtDistance`, in the same file, derives the complete
  derivative conclusion from scalar boundedness at distance using the proved sublevel estimate.

The last three declarations are in
`DifferentialGeometry.PDE.RicciFlow.Perelman.CanonicalNeighborhood.FiniteHorn`.

The source estimates use the actual proved `canonical_neighborhood_local_propagation` theorem.
On the tail, pinching gives a scalar lower bound of minus one. The final sublevel proof applies
the stronger scalar-scale estimate below with `Q = max A 1`. Each exceptional source is
controlled separately using its own global curvature bound and positive backward depth; a
finite maximum handles all exceptional indices. No bound shared by all derivative orders is
asserted.

The metric-independent covariant-step bridge and the dimension-at-most-one derivative results
were moved from compactness files to their curvature topic homes:
`Geometry/Curvature/CurvatureOperator/Derivatives/Covariant.lean` and
`Geometry/Curvature/DimensionOne/Derivatives.lean`. Their existing public names remain available.
All four new modules are registered in the flat root.

## Proven spatial point picking

Commit `1d52378c9` adds `NormalizedSequence.exists_terminal_scalar_point_selection` in
`Perelman/CanonicalNeighborhood/NormalizedPointSelection.lean`. From failure of
`BoundedAtDistance X`, it constructs a strictly increasing subsequence, centers with scalar
curvatures tending to infinity, and positive radii such that curvature times radius squared
tends to infinity. Scalar curvature on each selected closed ball is at most twice the center
value, and the entire selected ball lies in one fixed buffered terminal base ball. Both the
centers and the balls are in the actual source manifolds.

The proof first uses each source's own global curvature bound to ensure that curvature escape
can be selected beyond every finite prefix. It maximizes scalar curvature times the square of
the remaining distance to the buffered boundary, then selects one quarter of this remaining
distance as radius. The resulting factor is at most `16/9`, hence at most two. This is the
weighted argument of MSM163 chapter 18, `notes_and_commentary:lbl199`, with a different fixed
radius fraction. It requires no curvature-sign assumption or model information.

The shared weighted maximum proof is now `Metric.exists_weighted_point_selection` in
`Geometry/Metric/PointPicking.lean`, with a Riemannian version in
`Geometry/Metric/RiemannianPointPicking.lean`. The metric result needs only a pseudometric space,
compactness of the particular closed ball, and continuity on that ball. The Riemannian version
has no artificial positive-dimension or global-completeness assumption. The existing ASCR
point-selection proof reuses this common result. Its two public statements are unchanged.

The three new point-selection declarations and the two ASCR consumers passed all thirteen
applicable declaration linters and the standard-axiom-only audit. Fresh leaf builds passed.

## Proven scalar-scale parabolic estimates

Commit `df6ffa0c68ca428cf442ae5503e810a25b6cec3c` proves two results in
`Perelman/CanonicalNeighborhood/NormalizedCurvatureWindows.lean`:

- `exists_parabolic_curvature_bound_at_terminal_scalar_scale` produces positive constants
  `epsStar`, `c`, and `C` depending on kappa. For each admissible normalized sequence with
  epsilon at most this threshold, eventually in the source index, simultaneously for every
  `Q >= 1` and every terminal point with `R(0,p) <= Q`, the actual fixed terminal ball of radius
  `c / sqrt Q` has `|Rm| <= C Q` throughout `[-c/Q, 0]`. The theorem also provides inclusion
  of that closed time interval in the actual source carrier.
- `exists_curvDerivNorm_bound_at_terminal_scalar_scale` produces an epsilon threshold and a
  nonnegative coefficient function `B : Nat -> Real`. Eventually in the source index, for every
  `Q >= 1`, terminal point with `R(0,p) <= Q`, and order `m`, it gives
  `|nabla^m Rm|(0,p) <= B(m) Q (sqrt Q)^m`. The tail is shared across orders; the bound itself
  depends on the order. The proof checks the source regular interval and applies the genuine
  terminal-ball Shi theorem, with the time and radius factors simplified explicitly.

The pinching step is uniform even when `Q` grows with the source index. With
`L = 1 + |R(0,p)| <= 3 Q`, use `exists_forall_rescalePinchingFunction_le` at combined scale
`X.scale i * Q` and argument `4 L / Q <= 12`. This bounds the relative error by `Q` using one
source tail, without an exact nonnegative curvature or Ricci assumption.

The same commit proves `exists_parabolic_point_selection_of_not_boundedAtDistance` in
`Perelman/CanonicalNeighborhood/NormalizedParabolicPointSelection.lean`. Failure of scalar
boundedness produces the actual contained balls above with `Q_i r_i^2 -> infinity`, together
with a fixed positive rescaled backward duration `tau` and a fixed curvature constant `C`.
On each selected terminal ball, `|Rm| <= C Q_i` throughout `[-tau/Q_i, 0]`, eventually in `i`.
This controls balls of diverging radius after curvature rescaling for a fixed backward slab.
It does not construct an ancient solution or rule out the original curvature escape.

All three declarations are in the `FiniteHorn` namespace stated above. The two new modules
are registered in the flat root. The existing sublevel derivative proof now uses the scalar-scale
derivative theorem; its public statements are unchanged.

## Mathematical references

The read-only library is `/Users/bennettchow/Documents/Codex/RicciFlowBooksLatex`.

- MSM144, `tex/chapters/chapter14.tex`, `notes_and_commentary:lbl550`: local higher derivative
  estimates on a compact initial ball, including positive times up to the terminal time. The new
  terminal-ball theorem supplies the earlier ball and its curvature bound before using the
  formal endpoint version.
- MSM163, `tex/chapters/chapter18.tex`, `notes_and_commentary:lbl199`: weighted spatial point
  picking from curvature escape on a bounded ball; only compactness of the buffered closed ball
  is needed.
- MSM163, `tex/chapters/chapter20.tex`, `notes_and_commentary:lbl477`: the bounded-distance lemma
  there assumes nonnegative curvature operator and the Harnack time-monotonicity property. These
  are not hypotheses of a normalized source and must not be inferred from almost-pinching.
- MSM163, `tex/chapters/chapter22.tex`, `notes_and_commentary:lbl621`, `lbl623`, `lbl624`: the
  finite-interval setting and point-picking arguments use individual source curvature bounds;
  those bounds do not become uniform over a sequence.

## Remaining target

`bounded_curvature_at_distance` in `FiniteHornStructure.lean` is still unproved, with its original
source text unchanged. Its remaining mathematical obstacle is scalar control at arbitrary bounded
terminal distance. The derivative producer above is ready once that scalar estimate is obtained.
The new point-picking and parabolic-control producers prepare the escape case for geometric
compactness and exclusion, but do not supply that exclusion. A local ball estimate cannot by
itself exclude finite-distance curvature escape.

The high-curvature blowup theorem and the full Poincare development are not complete. The previous
handoff's cautions concerning cone exclusion versus cone construction, terminal limit construction,
and compatible ancient extension still apply. In particular, one backward slab is not an ancient
solution, and the existing theorem named `finite_horn_produces_cone` excludes a cone.

## Verification of the derivative checkpoint

The initial handoff's `verify.sh` passed before source changes. Fresh leaf builds for the new
source estimates passed, including their rebuilt compactness dependents. Seven public declarations
(three moved, four new) passed all thirteen applicable declaration linters; each has only
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` in its transitive axiom closure. The previous phase's
nine-declaration audit also passed again after the derivative checkpoint.

The derivative checkpoint's full root build passed 20,147 jobs with exactly 21 retained `sorry`
warnings. Its dependency audit found the same three reachable proof holes as the original
handoff: `bounded_curvature_at_distance`, `terminal_limit_global_bound`, and `ancient_extension`.

After the scalar-scale checkpoint, the combined audit checked fifteen public declarations with
thirteen applicable linters. All passed, and every transitive axiom closure was a subset of
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. This covers ten new declarations, three moved
declarations, and the two existing ASCR consumers. The elaborated statement queries are included
in the same temporary driver and log, `/private/tmp/wt17-source-estimates-audit.lean` and `.log`.

The final full build at `df6ffa0c68ca428cf442ae5503e810a25b6cec3c` passed **20,152 jobs** with
exactly **21 retained `sorry` warnings and no other diagnostics**. Its log is
`/private/tmp/wt17-source-estimates-root.log`. No Lean source was edited during any build.
The target's complete source file compares identically to the original handoff commit.

The original handoff's `verify.sh` also passed again after the final source changes: seven fresh
source elaborations, nine declarations checked by thirteen linters, standard axiom closures,
original statement compatibility, and exactly twenty-one retained holes in eleven files. Its
dependency traversal again found only the same three reachable blowup holes. Evidence is in
`/private/tmp/wt17-kappa-verification.R7CQO3`; the command log is
`/private/tmp/wt17-source-estimates-compatibility.log`.

Reproduce the source builds with:

```sh
lake build DifferentialGeometry.Geometry.Metric.PointPicking \
  DifferentialGeometry.Geometry.Metric.RiemannianPointPicking \
  DifferentialGeometry.Geometry.Flow.RicciFlow.Estimates.Shi.Derivatives.TerminalBall \
  DifferentialGeometry.Geometry.Flow.RicciFlow.Perelman.CanonicalNeighborhood.NormalizedPointSelection \
  DifferentialGeometry.Geometry.Flow.RicciFlow.Perelman.CanonicalNeighborhood.NormalizedCurvatureWindows \
  DifferentialGeometry.Geometry.Flow.RicciFlow.Perelman.CanonicalNeighborhood.NormalizedParabolicPointSelection \
  DifferentialGeometry.Geometry.Flow.RicciFlow.Perelman.CanonicalNeighborhood.NormalizedTerminalDerivatives
lake build DifferentialGeometry
bash docs/handoffs/kappa-solutions-2026-09-20/verify.sh
git diff --check
```

For fresh source elaboration and declaration probes, use the repository's exact options:

```sh
lake env lean -Dpp.unicode.fun=true -DmaxSynthPendingDepth=3 -DautoImplicit=false \
  -Dweak.linter.mathlibStandardSet=true -Dlinter.style.header=false \
  -Dlinter.style.longLine=false /path/to/probe.lean
```

The combined probe imports `NormalizedTerminalDerivatives`, `NormalizedParabolicPointSelection`,
and `KappaSolutions.AscrPointSelection`. Use the earlier handoff's `getChecks`/`lintCore` driver
on all ten new public declarations listed above, the three moved declarations
`curvStep_eq_covStep`, `curvCovDeriv_eq_zero_of_finrank_le_one`, and
`curvDerivNorm_eq_zero_of_finrank_le_one` in `DifferentialGeometry.CheegerGromovCompactness`, and
`exists_ascrPointSelection` and `exists_scalarAscrPointSelection` in the kappa-solution namespace.
Query both `#check @...` and `#print axioms ...` for each declaration.

The new proof layers pass their mathematical, API, compiler, linter, and axiom checks. The
requested `bounded_curvature_at_distance` theorem is **Not accepted** as a completed proof:
its original `sorry` remains, and the geometric exclusion of finite-distance curvature escape
has not been constructed.

Local evidence is in `/private/tmp/wt17-normalized-derivatives-audit.lean`, its `.log`, and
`/private/tmp/wt17-continuation-kappa-audit.log`. These temporary files are not portable handoff
artifacts. The earlier handoff contains the reproducible audit-driver pattern and original
statement compatibility probes. Its fixed job/debt counts describe its own snapshot.
