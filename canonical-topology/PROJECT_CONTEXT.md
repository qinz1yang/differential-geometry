# Poincare local-homology checkpoint

This directory is a separate portable `PoincareLean` project prepared for
additive publication within the shared DifferentialGeometry Git repository. Its Lean
library is `Poincare`; its sources retain the original mathematical namespaces.

The source baseline is the recovered Chapter 35 commit
`b45bfa009368c8f5f531e10f4f5280e90079d6ad`. This checkpoint includes 103 modules:
the dependency closure of fourteen roots covering local homology, derivatives,
determinant signs, oriented chart compatibility, compact chart classes,
Mayer–Vietoris, manifold compact-support homology and the actual
absolute-to-relative-empty comparison, plus actual consumer
dependencies. Final request
`1789264345451073915-topology_checkpoint-f04d0bd9` passed in Slurm 13781140
in 91.29 seconds. RelativeEmpty and root freshly compiled in the preceding
artifact request e5804880 in 1:18.48 with zero diagnostics; the final gate
keeps those exact production sources and repairs only the combined consumer
universe scope. All 50 added public exports, 206 guards and 111 signature/axiom
pairs pass; all 106 previous pairs and five new original imported pairs match
byte for byte. All 102 prior leaves remain unchanged and retain their earlier
compilation evidence.

The actual absolute-to-relative-empty map is now a linear equivalence in
every degree and topological space, with its defining map equation exposed.
Nonzero degree-zero and naturality consumers pass.

The new results construct a compact neighborhood on which a class's
restriction vanishes when its actual point restriction is zero. Compact
relative homology on any Hausdorff manifold charted over a finite-dimensional
real normed model vanishes above the model dimension. In the model dimension
or above, point restrictions determine compact classes, and every nonzero
compact class has a nonzero point restriction. Rank zero, nonclosed supports
for local vanishing, and noncompact ambient manifolds are included.
No orientation or smoothness is required by these results.

The earlier actual Mayer–Vietoris lifts, conditional uniqueness, compact
carrier and neighborhood-extension results, and oriented compact chart classes
retain their public statements and proof bodies. Global oriented generators
remain open.
[provenance/SNAPSHOT.json](provenance/SNAPSHOT.json) records exact source and
configuration identity and preserves the earlier validation records. It is not
the full recovered Chapter 35 project.

Preserve Lean `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`, Mathlib
`0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474`, and DifferentialGeometry `v0.1.2`
at `1b535dd102b94cc42b107cca27059687888f08b3`. Use DifferentialGeometry only
as a pinned upstream dependency; no included Lean module currently imports it.

The mathematical work belongs to the canonical-topology workstream described
in the enclosing Schoenflies controller's
[two-project prompt](../../plan/della_two_projects_prompt.md),
[topology brief](../../plan/CANONICAL_TOPOLOGY_SPINOFF_BRIEF.md), and
[active plan](../../plan/plan_smooth_schoenflies.md). Those controller records
are external to this portable package. The package README records its limited
delivered scope and checkpoint status independently.

The frozen topology handoff is still missing. Do not reconstruct its public
contract from this foundations checkpoint. Neither the full canonical topology
suite nor the combined Schoenflies/topology goal is complete.

The older project context and agent instructions are preserved under
`provenance/RECOVERED_*.md` as historical source records. Their old machine paths,
branch destinations and release claims are not current operating instructions.
