# Poincare local-homology checkpoint

This directory is a separate portable `PoincareLean` project prepared for
additive publication within the shared DifferentialGeometry Git repository. Its Lean
library is `Poincare`; its sources retain the original mathematical namespaces.

The source baseline is the recovered Chapter 35 commit
`b45bfa009368c8f5f531e10f4f5280e90079d6ad`. This checkpoint includes the 68-module
dependency closure of five extended/new local-homology and derivative modules.
[provenance/SNAPSHOT.json](provenance/SNAPSHOT.json) records the exact source and
configuration identity. It is not the full recovered Chapter 35 project.

Preserve Lean `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`, Mathlib
`0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474`, and DifferentialGeometry `v0.1.2`
at `1b535dd102b94cc42b107cca27059687888f08b3`. Use DifferentialGeometry only
as a pinned upstream dependency; no included Lean module currently imports it.

The mathematical work belongs to the canonical-topology workstream described
in the enclosing Schoenflies controller's
[two-project prompt](../../plan/della_two_projects_prompt.md),
[topology brief](../../plan/CANONICAL_TOPOLOGY_SPINOFF_BRIEF.md), and
[active plan](../../plan/plan_smooth_schoenflies.md). Those controller records
are external to this portable package. The package README records its limited
delivered scope and verified checkpoint independently.

The frozen topology handoff is still missing. Do not reconstruct its public
contract from this foundations checkpoint. Neither the full canonical topology
suite nor the combined Schoenflies/topology goal is complete.

The older project context and agent instructions are preserved under
`provenance/RECOVERED_*.md` as historical source records. Their old machine paths,
branch destinations and release claims are not current operating instructions.
