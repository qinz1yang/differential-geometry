# Semi-locally simply connected spaces

A topological space `X` is *semi-locally simply connected* if every point
has a neighbourhood `U` such that every loop in `U` (based at the point)
is null-homotopic in `X`. This is the point-set hypothesis required for
the standard construction of the universal cover (Hatcher, Prop. 1.36):
the universal cover exists for spaces that are connected, locally path
connected, and semi-locally simply connected.

`Mathlib` does not yet provide this typeclass, so we introduce it here
in the same style as `LocPathConnectedSpace` and `SimplyConnectedSpace`
(a `class` with a single proof-valued field `out`).

We then establish, as the manifold instance, that every smooth manifold
modelled on an inner-product space is semi-locally simply connected: each
chart pulls a neighbourhood of `x` back to an open ball in the model
space, which is contractible, so every loop in the chart neighbourhood
is null-homotopic.
