# Joint Fréchet differentiability of the flow at the central orbit

For a time-dependent vector field `f : ℝ → E → E` on a Banach space `E`, jointly `C^1` in
`(t, x)`, and a local Picard–Lindelöf flow `Φ : E × ℝ → E` packaged by `IsLocalFlow`, this
file establishes joint Fréchet differentiability of `(x, t) ↦ Φ ⟨x, t⟩` at the centre
points `(x₀, t)`, for `t` in the open uniform interval `Ioo (t₀ - T) (t₀ + T)` on which the
space-partial derivative is controlled.

The joint Fréchet derivative is the *coproduct* of the two partials:

* In the spatial direction: the variational linear map at time `t`,
  `variationalLinearMapAt … ht : E →L[ℝ] E`.
* In the time direction: the scalar-multiplication CLM `s ↦ s • f t (Φ ⟨x₀, t⟩)`.

Splitting the residual into two pieces gives:

```
Φ (x₀ + δ, t + s) − Φ (x₀, t) − Lmap δ − s • f t (Φ ⟨x₀, t⟩)
  = [Φ (x₀ + δ, t + s) − Φ (x₀ + δ, t) − s • f t (Φ ⟨x₀, t⟩)]  -- time piece
    + [Φ (x₀ + δ, t) − Φ (x₀, t) − Lmap δ]                      -- space piece
```

The space piece is `o(‖δ‖) = o(‖(δ, s)‖)` by `hasFDerivAt_flow_at_initial_of_isLocalFlow`.
The time piece is `o(|s|) = o(‖(δ, s)‖)` by a mean-value estimate: along the orbit
`α (u) := Φ (x₀ + δ, u)`, the function `g (u) := α u − (u − t) • f t (Φ ⟨x₀, t⟩)` has
derivative `f u (α u) − f t (Φ ⟨x₀, t⟩)`, which is uniformly small near `t` by joint
continuity of `f` and `Φ`.

The `ContDiffOn` upgrade is **not** delivered here: that would require continuity of the
variational linear map jointly in the base point `(x, t)`, i.e., extending V.2.b.1's
`variationalLinearMapAt` to varying central orbits.  This is a substantial follow-up and
is left for a subsequent step.

All theorems are formulated on a generic Banach space `E`; `[InnerProductSpace ℝ E]` is *not*
used.  No manifold or tensor file is imported.

/-- **Joint Fréchet derivative of the flow at the central initial condition.**

Given a local flow `Φ` of a jointly `C^1` time-dependent vector field `f`, a uniform-interval
`Icc (t₀ - T) (t₀ + T) ⊆ Icc tmin tmax` on which the operator norm of the linearization along
the central orbit is bounded by `M` with `M · T < 1`, and `0 < r` so we have a closed ball of
positive radius around `x₀` inside the flow's spatial domain, the map
`(x, t) ↦ Φ ⟨x, t⟩` is jointly Fréchet differentiable at `(x₀, t)` for every `t` in the open
sub-interval `Ioo (t₀ - T) (t₀ + T)`.  Its derivative is the *coproduct* of the variational
linear map (in the spatial direction) and the multiplication by `f t (Φ ⟨x₀, t⟩)` (in the
time direction). -/
