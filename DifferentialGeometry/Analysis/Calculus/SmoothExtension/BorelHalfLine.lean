# Borel jet-realization on the half-line

Given a function `g : ℝ → F` which is `C^∞` on the closed upper half-line
`Set.Ici 0`, we construct a globally `C^∞` function `h : ℝ → F` whose full Taylor
jet at `0` matches the one-sided jet of `g` at `0`:
`iteratedDeriv n h 0 = iteratedDerivWithin n g (Set.Ici 0) 0` for every `n`.

This is the classical Borel construction (every formal power series is the Taylor
series of a smooth function), specialised to realize a prescribed one-sided jet.
The downstream gluing API then stitches `h` on `Set.Iic 0` to `g` on `Set.Ici 0`.

## Construction

Write `c n := iteratedDerivWithin n g (Set.Ici 0) 0` for the prescribed jet
coefficients. We build `h` as a series `h t = ∑' n, f n t` where each term
`f n t = c n • (lam n ^ (-n : ℤ) * g₀ n (lam n * t))` for a fixed compactly
supported smooth bump-monomial `g₀ n s = χ s * s ^ n / n !` (with `χ` equal to
`1` near `0` and supported in `[-2, 2]`), and a rapidly increasing sequence of
scales `lam n ≥ 1`. The scales are chosen so large that the `k`-th derivative of
the `n`-th term is bounded by `2 ^ (-n)` for every `k < n`, which forces the
series and all its term-by-term derivatives to converge. Near `0` we have
`χ (lam n * t) = 1`, so `f n` agrees with `c n • ((lam n * t) ^ n / n !) *
lam n ^ (-n)= c n • (t ^ n / n !)` there, whose `k`-th derivative at `0` is
`c k` if `n = k` and `0` otherwise.
