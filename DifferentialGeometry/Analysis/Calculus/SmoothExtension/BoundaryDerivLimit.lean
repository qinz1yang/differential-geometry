# Derivative-limit theorem at a closed endpoint (boundary-regularity primitive)

The foundational 1-D analytic step toward the parabolic boundary-regularity leverage ("corollary (b)"
in the Ricci-flow `hglue` route): if `f` is continuous on `[a,b]`, differentiable on the open interval
`(a,b)`, and its derivative `f'` has a limit `L` as `t → a⁺`, then `f` has right-derivative `L` at `a`.
This is the classical derivative-limit theorem; Mathlib has only the uniform-limit-of-sequences forms.

Proof: for `a < s < t < b` the mean-value inequality (`norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_deriv_right_le_segment`)
on `[s,t]` — where `f` is differentiable — bounds `‖f t − f s − (t−s)·L‖ ≤ ε·(t−s)` once `‖f'−L‖ ≤ ε`
nearby; letting `s → a⁺` (continuity of `f`) gives `‖f t − f a − (t−a)·L‖ ≤ ε·(t−a)`, hence the slope
tends to `L`.
